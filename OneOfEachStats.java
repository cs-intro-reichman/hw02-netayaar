		//// In the previous version of this program, you used a statement like:

		//// Where "rnd" is the variable that stores the generated random value.
		//// In this version of the program, replace this statement with:
		//// double rnd = generator.nextDouble();
		//// This statement will generate a random value in the range [0,1),
		//// just like you had in the previous version, except that the 
		//// randomization will be based on the given seed.
		//// This is the only change that you have to do in the program.
